# LangAI Coach: Initial Prototype

## Overview

The LangAI Coach prototype is a preliminary implementation of an AI-powered language learning assistant, focusing on two main components: Personalized Curriculum and Interactive Conversational Practice. The system utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 APIs to simulate real-time language interactions and provides the foundational framework for a personalized education platform.

## Directory Structure

The LangAI Coach application is organized as follows:

- **LangAI_Coach/**: Root directory containing the main application code.
  - **main.py**: Entry point of the application.
  - **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary Python packages for the application.
  - **langai_coach/**: Package directory containing the core modules.
    - **__init__.py**: Initializes the LangAI Coach application with core components.
    - **curriculum.py**: Handles the creation and management of a personalized learning curriculum for users.
    - **conversation.py**: Facilitates the interactive conversation practice feature using OpenAI's API.
    - **user.py**: Manages user data, including profile and proficiency levels.
    - **utils.py**: Placeholder for utility functions or external API management.

## Core Components

### 1. Personalized Curriculum

- The curriculum module aims to build a learning path tailored to the user's skills and progress. 
- Currently, this is a static representation, with a placeholder for future integration of AI-driven personalization logic.
- Users are offered lessons based on predefined levels such as "Basics," "Intermediate," and "Advanced."

### 2. Interactive Conversational Practice

- This component provides a platform for users to engage in conversation with AI, mimicking interactions with a native speaker.
- Utilizes OpenAI's text generation capabilities to provide responses based on user input.
- Offers real-time feedback to enhance language skills through practice and conversation.

### 3. User Management

- A dedicated module for managing user profiles, which incorporates gathering initial data like user name and language proficiency level.
- This data is used to personalize the learning experience.

## How to Run

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed, along with dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
2. **API Key**: Replace `'your-api-key'` in the `conversation.py` with a valid OpenAI API key.
3. **Run Application**: Execute the `main.py` script to start interacting with the LangAI Coach.
4. **Interact**: Follow on-screen instructions to view the personalized curriculum or start a conversation session.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of adaptive learning algorithms for dynamic curriculum creation.
- Expansion of conversational capabilities with more nuanced AI responses.
- Integration of multimedia content to enhance cultural context and immersion in language learning.
- Addition of progress tracking and analytics for insightful feedback on user performance.

## Notes

This prototype demonstrates key functionalities and sets the stage for a more comprehensive solution. As an initial version, it focuses on structuring the application for scalability and ease of extension while laying groundwork for future development and integration of additional features.
